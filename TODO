- write classes/functions
- XML-based config
-x XML syntax
--- x regex btags - case-insensitive? this can be represented in-pattern:
    x https://stackoverflow.com/a/9655186/733214
--- remove sources stuff - that should be in the guest definitions.
-x configuration generator
--- x print end result xml config to stderr for easier redirection? or print prompts to stderr and xml to stdout?
-- x XSD for validation
-- Flask app for generating config?
-- TKinter (or pygame?) GUI?

- ensure we use docstrings in a Sphinx-compatible manner?
  https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html

- for docs, 3.x (as of 3.10) was 2.4M.

- x Need ability to write/parse mtree specs (or a similar equivalent) for applying ownerships/permissions to overlay files

--- i think writing is mostly done/straightforward; still need to work on parsing mode octals for files
