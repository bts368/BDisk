- mtree.spec
  This file is an example mtree spec sheet that one may use for an overlay. It was generated by the command "mtree -c -K all -p /home/bts".
  If you're on Arch, a port of mtree can be found in the AUR under the package name "nmtree" (it's maintained by the same author as BDisk!).
  If you're on Debian or Ubuntu (or forks thereof), you can find it in the "freebsd-buildutils" package. (The executable is called "fmtree").
  If you're on Gentoo, it's in sys-apps/mtree.
  If you're on RHEL/CentOS, the "extras" repository has gomtree, which (although written in Go) should be able to produce mtree spec files (but this is unknown for certain).
